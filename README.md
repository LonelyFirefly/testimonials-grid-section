## Overview

### Links

-   Card URL: [Vercel URl](https://testimonials-grid-section-nu-mocha.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

```html
<link
	rel="icon"
	type="image/png"
	sizes="32x32"
	href="./images/favicon-32x32.png" />
```
Here I learnt how to add a favicon to my website.

```css
.card {
	border-radius: 10px;
	box-shadow: 14px 12px 25px -8px rgba(163, 135, 135, 0.56);
	-webkit-box-shadow: 14px 12px 25px -8px rgba(163, 135, 135, 0.56);
	-moz-box-shadow: 14px 12px 25px -8px rgba(163, 135, 135, 0.56);
	padding: 30px;
}
```
cssgenerator.org reaaly helped me with box-shadow. You can find lots of useful tools as well there.
